    //A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function 
    //declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source 
    //files. There are two types of header files: the files that the programmer 
    //writes and the files that comes with your compiler.
    //Including a header file is equal to copying the content of the header file 
    //but we do not do it because it will be error-prone and it is not a good 
    //idea to copy the content of a header file in the source files, especially 
    //if we have multiple source files in a program.
    


// any code in here will be copied and put in the beginning with the 
// pre preprocessor directives
#define NAME "bob"
#define AGE  23
// to make this file right click on header files and go new >  C header file
// or empty file (does not matter. NOTE: FOR SOME REASON WHEN YOU MAKE IT, IT
// DOES NOT AUTOMTICALY GO IN THE HEADER FILE FOLDER SO YOU HAVE TO MANYALLY
// MOVE IT THERE. If you make a empty file it may not show up, so just open it
// by file > open file.
